# Podomoro-tracker
---
This project has no official name right now. 

It's a desktop app to track your work sessions. It's built with Sveltekit, Rust and Tauri App (more complexion is coming soon: d3, rive-app, luxon).

## Why?
---
I'm building this to:
- learn Tauri App (build desktop apps with Rust and a webview)
- learn how to do releases on Github (using Github Actions)
- improve my knowledge in Rust 
- improve my knowledge in Deno & Supabase (using the v.2 of the SDK)
- improve my knowledge in Figma (using the latest features: Component Properties & Base Components)
- track my work sessions (I'm currently working remote for Bazen)
- Collect my data for a future analysis (Data Science), i have a great background in statistics and data analysis. I'm really focused on tracking and analyzing all my personal data this year.
